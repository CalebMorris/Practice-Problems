Square Subsequences(25 points)

A string is called a square string if it can be obtained by concatenating two copies of the same string. For example, "abab", "aa" are square strings, while "aaa", "abba" are not. Given a string, how many subsequences of the string are square strings? A subsequence of a string can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters from it, and maintaining the relative order of the remaining characters.

Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each case contains a string S.

Output:
Output T lines, one for each test case containing the required answer modulo 1000000007.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 20
S will have at most 200 characters.

Sample Input:
3
aaa
abab
baaba


Sample Output:
3
3
6

Explanation:
For the first case, there are 3 subsequences of length 2, all of which are square strings.
For the second case, the subsequences "abab", "aa", "bb" are square strings.
